> This HTML course for web developers provides a solid overview for developers, from novice to expert level HTML.

Welcome to HTML! HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the backbone of the web, providing the content, as well as the structure of that content, that you see displayed in your web browser.

HTML elements are the nodes that make up the Document Object Model.

Sites that are built with JavaScript frameworks are really just manipulating HTML. In turn, it's important to mark up your HTML in a way that scripts can easily parse and that assistive technologies can easily understand. This means writing HTML code with modern standards.

## Overview of HTML

> A brief introduction to the key concepts in HTML.

The closing tag is the same tag as the opening tag, preceded by a slash.

Elements and tags aren't the exact same thing, though many people use the terms interchangeably. The tag name is the content in the brackets. The tag includes the brackets. An "element" is the opening and closing tags, and all the content between those tags, including nested elements.

That being said, while it is valid to omit tags, don't.

There are two types of elements: replaced and non-replaced.

Non-replaced elements have opening and (sometimes optional) closing tags that surround them and may include text and other tags as sub-elements. These enclosing tags can turn a phrase or image into a hyperlink, can make a sentence into a header, can give emphasis to words, and so on.

Replaced elements are replaced by objects, be it a graphical user interface (UI) widget in the case of most form controls, or a raster or scalable image file in the case of most images.

```html
<input type="range" />
<img
  src="switch.svg"
  alt="light switch"
/>
```

Void elements are all self-closing elements and are represented by one tag. They cannot contain text content or nested elements. <br>, <col>, <embed>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <link>, <meta>, <source>, <track>, and <wbr>, among others.

Replaced elements and void elements are often confused.

Most replaced elements are void elements, but not all. The video, picture, object, and iframe elements are replaced, but aren't void. They can all contain other elements or text, so they all have a closing tag.

Most void elements are replaced; but again, not all, as we saw with base, link, param, and meta. Why have a void element, which can't have any content, that isn't replaced and thereby doesn't render anything to the screen? To provide information about the content! The information is provided by the elements' attributes.

Attributes provide information about the element.

The semantics, or role, of an element is important to assistive technologies and, in some cases, search engines. HTML should be used to structure content, not to define the content's appearance. Appearance is the realm of CSS

As the browser parses HTML, it creates a JavaScript object for every element and section of text encountered. These objects are called nodes—element nodes and text nodes, respectively.

There is an interface to define the functionality of every HTML element. The HTML DOM API provides access to and control of every HTML element via the DOM, providing interfaces for the HTML element and all the HTML classes that inherit from it. The HTMLElement interface represents the HTML element and all of its descendant nodes.

## Document structure

> Learn how to structure your HTML documents with a solid foundation.

While the head of the document isn't visible to the sighted visitor, it is vital to make your site function. It contains all the meta information, including information for search engines and social media results, icons for the browser tab and mobile home screen shortcut, and the behavior and presentation of your content.

The doctype tells the browser to use standards mode. If omitted, browsers will use a different rendering mode known as quirks mode.

The <html> element is the root element for an HTML document. It is the parent of the <head> and <body>, containing everything in the HTML document other than the doctype.

The lang language attribute added to the <html> tag defines the main language of the document. The value of the lang attribute is a two- or three-letter ISO language code followed by the region. The region is optional, but recommended, as a language can vary greatly between regions. This language declaration enables screen readers, search engines, and translation services to know the document language. If there is text within the page that is in a language different from the main document language, the lang attribute should be used to identify exceptions to the main language within the document.

The <head>, or document metadata header, contains all the metadata for a site or application. The body contains the visible content.

The very first element in the <head> should be the charset character encoding declaration. It comes before the title to ensure the browser can render the characters in that title and all the characters in the rest of the document. However, you should use UTF-8, It's the encoding type required by HTML5. The character encoding is inherited into everything in the document, even style and script.

The contents for the document title, the text between the opening and closing <title> tags, are displayed in the browser tab, the list of open windows, the history, search results, and, unless redefined with <meta> tags, in social media cards.

The other meta tag that should be considered essential is the viewport meta tag. Prevents the site's content from being sized down to fit a 960px site onto a 320px screen, it is definitely recommended.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Machine Learning Workshop</title>
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width"
    />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

The preceding code means "make the site responsive, starting by making the width of the content the width of the screen".

There are three ways to include CSS: `<link>`, `<style>`, and the style attribute.

In link method, browser can cache the external file.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="styles.css"
/>
```

If you want your external style sheet styles to be within a cascade layer but you don't have access to edit the CSS file to put the layer information in it, you'll want to include the CSS with @import inside a <style>:

```html
<style>
  @import 'style.css' layer(firstLayer);
</style>
```

```html
<!-- Custom properties -->
<style>
  :root {
    --theme-color: #226daa;
  }
</style>
```

Styles, either via `<link>` or `<style>`, or both, should go in the head. Adding styles first prevents the unnecessary repainting that occurs if an element is styled after it is first rendered.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Machine Learning Workshop</title>
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width"
    />
    <style
      contenteditable
      style="display: block; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre"
    >
      head {
        display: block;
      }
      head * {
        display: none;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

이딴게 되네,,, While you can add inline styles on the `<style>`, it's way more fun to style your `<style>` in your `style`. I digress.

The link element is used to create relationships between the HTML document and external resources. It's preferable to include those related to meta information in the head and those related to performance in the `<body>`.

Use the <link> tag, with the rel="icon" attribute/value pair to identify the favicon to be used for your document. If you don't declare a favicon, the browser will look for a file named favicon.ico in the top-level directory (the website's root folder). There are two special non-standard kind of icons for Safari browser: apple-touch-icon for iOS devices and mask-icon for pinned tabs on macOS.

We use the alternate value of the rel attribute to identify translations, or alternate representations, of the site.

```html
<link
  rel="alternate"
  href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/fr/"
  hreflang="fr-FR"
/>
<link
  rel="alternate"
  href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/pt/"
  hreflang="pt-BR"
/>
<link
  rel="alternate"
  type="application/x-pdf"
  href="https://machinelearningworkshop.com/mlw.pdf"
/>
```

The rel="canonical" canonical link is most often used for cross-posting with publications and blogging platforms to credit the original source.

```html
<link
  rel="canonical"
  href="https://www.machinelearning.com"
/>
```

Only JavaScript and JavaScript modules get parsed and executed in `<script>` tag. The `<script>` tags can be used to encapsulate your code or to download an external file.

...We'll add the `<script>` at the bottom of the <body> rather than in the `<head>`. Why? Two reasons. We want to ensure elements exist before the script referencing them is encountered as we're not basing this script on a DOMContentLoaded event. And, mainly, JavaScript is not only render-blocking, but the browser stops downloading all assets when scripts are downloaded and doesn't resume downloading other assets until the JavaScript is executed. For this reason, you will often find JavaScript requests at the end of the document rather than in the head.

With defer, HTML rendering is not blocked during the download, and the JavaScript only executes after the document has otherwise finished rendering. With async, rendering isn't blocked during the download either, but once the script has finished downloading, the rendering is paused while the JavaScript is executed.

[Why don't self-closing script elements work?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69913/why-dont-self-closing-script-elements-work)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      console.log('First');
      var element = document.querySelector('#my-element');
      console.log(element);
    </script>
    <!-- defer only works on external scripts  -->
    <!-- This attribute must not be used if the src attribute is absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case it would have no effect. -->
    <script defer>
      console.log('Second');
      var element = document.querySelector('#my-element');
      console.log(element);
    </script>
    <!-- <script/> 안되네,,, -->
    <script
      defer
      src="./defer.js"
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="my-element" />
  </body>
</html>
```

There is another element that is only found in the `<head>`. Not used very often, the `<base>` element allows setting a default link URL and target. 쓰나,,,?

## Metadata

> How to use meta tags to provide information about your documents.

Everything in the head is actually meta data. Meta tag is basically replicating what could be set in an HTTP header

Originally the character set meta data was written as `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=<characterset>" />`

There are two main types of meta tags: pragma directives, with the http-equiv attribute like the charset meta tag used to have, and named meta types, like the viewport meta tag with the name attribute.

The specification defines seven pragma directives, most of which have other methods of being set.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta
      http-equiv="refresh"
      content="3"
    />
  </head>
</html>
```

The most useful pragma directive is content-security-policy, which enables defining a content policy for the current document.

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="content-security-policy"
  content="default-src https:"
/>
```

More often than not, you'll include named metadata. Include the name attribute, with the attribute value being the name of the metadata.

The description value is super important for SEO.

이외에도 robots, theme-color 등이 있다. Do not include keywords.

### Open Graph

Open Graph and similar meta tag protocols can be used to control how social media sites, like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook, display links to your content.

```html
<meta
  property="og:title"
  content="Machine Learning Workshop"
/>
<meta
  property="og:description"
  content="School for Machines Who Can't Learn Good and Want to Do Other Stuff Good Too"
/>
<meta
  property="og:image"
  content="http://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/image/all.png"
/>
<meta
  property="og:image:alt"
  content="Black and white line drawing of refrigerator, french door refrigerator, range, washer, fan, microwave, vaccuum, space heater and air conditioner"
/>
```

[Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/)

### Other useful meta information

If someone bookmarks your site, adding it to their home screen, or if your site is a progressive web application or otherwise works offline or without browser chrome features displayed, you can provide application icons for the mobile device's home screen.

```html
<link
  rel="apple-touch-startup-image"
  href="icons/ios-portrait.png"
  media="orientation: portrait"
/>
<link
  rel="apple-touch-startup-image"
  href="icons/ios-landscape.png"
  media="orientation: landscape"
/>
```

If your site or application is web-app capable, meaning the site can stand on its own with minimal UI, such as no back button, you can use meta tags to tell the browser that too:

```html
<meta
  name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable"
  content="yes"
/>
<meta
  name="mobile-web-app-capable"
  content="yes"
/>
```

If someone is going to save your icon to their tiny device's home screen, you want to provide the operating system with a short name.

```html
<meta
  name="apple-mobile-web-app-title"
  content="MLW"
/>
<meta
  name="application-name"
  content="MLW"
/>
```

You can more simply and succinctly include short_name: MLW in a webmanifest file. The manifest file can prevent an unwieldy header full of <link> and <meta> tags.

```html
<link
  rel="manifest"
  href="/mlw.webmanifest"
/>
```

## Semantic HTML

> Using the correct HTML elements to describe your document content.

Semantic means "relating to meaning". Writing semantic HTML means using HTML elements to structure your content based on each element's meaning, not its appearance.

...we can understand the architecture even without understanding the content because semantic elements provide meaning and structure.

Semantic markup isn't just about making markup easier for developers to read; it's mostly about making markup easy for automated tools to decipher.

### Accessiblity object model (AOM)

As the prowser parses the content received, it builds the DOM and CSSOM. It then builds an accessibliltiy tree. The AOM is like a semantic version of the DOM.

HTML is generally, by default, accessible. Our job as developers is to both protect HTML's default accessible nature and ensure that we maximize accessibility.

### The `role` attribute

The role attribute describes the role an element has in the context of the document. The role attribute is a global attribute—meaning it is valid on all elements.

Semantic elements each have an implicit role, some depending on the context.

Element role names are important in building the AOM.

The implicit role, or explicit role value, informs the user to expect element-specific default user interactions.

Using the role attribute, you can give any element a role, including a different role than the tag implies.

While the role attribute can be used to add semantics to any element, you should instead use elements with the implicit role you need.

### Semantic elements

HTML should be used to structure content, not to define content's appearance.

Coding HTML in a logical, semantic, and meaningful way helps to ensure CSS is applied as intended.

When you understand the semantics of each element and are aware of why choosing the right element is important, you will generally be able to make the right choice without much additional effort.

**Landmarks** provide structure to web content and ensure important sections of content are easily keyboard navigable for screen reader users.

Note that `<header>` and `<footer>` are landmarks, with the roles of banner and contentinfo respectively, when they are not nested in other landmarks.

## Heading and sections

> How to correctly use sectioning elements to give meaning to your content.

The `<header>` element isn't always a landmark. It has different semantics depending on where it is nested. When the `<header>` is top level, it is the site banner, a landmark role, which you may have noted in the role code block.

When a `<header>` is nested in `<main>`, `<article>`, or `<section>`, it just identifies it as the header for that section and isn't a landmark.

The `<nav>` element identifies content as navigation. As this `<nav>` is nested in the site heading, it is the main navigation for the site. If it was nested in an `<article>` or `<section>`, it would be internal navigation for that section only.

Similar to `<header>`, whether the footer is a landmark depends on where the footer is nested.

Footers are often where you will find contact information, wrapped in `<address>`, the contact address element. This is one element that is not very well named; it is used to enclose the contact information for individuals or organizations, not physical mailing addresses.

헤더와 푸터는 only sometimes being landmark임이 특이해서 먼저 다룸. Full-time sectioning element를 살펴보자.

A layout with a header, two sidebars, and a footer, is known as the **holy grail** layout.

```html
<body>
  <div class="parent">
    <header class="section coral">Header</header>
    <div class="left-side section blue">Left Sidebar</div>
    <main class="section green">Main Content</main>
    <div class="right-side section yellow">Right Sidebar</div>
    <footer class="section coral">Footer</footer>
  </div>
</body>

<style>
  .parent {
    display: grid;
    grid-template: auto 1fr auto / auto 1fr auto;
  }

  header {
    padding: 2rem;
    grid-column: 1 / 4;
    background-color: palevioletred;
  }

  .left-side {
    grid-column: 1 / 2;
    background-color: blue;
  }

  main {
    grid-column: 2 / 3;
    background-color: royalblue;
  }

  .right-side {
    grid-column: 3 / 4;
    background-color: palegoldenrod;
  }

  footer {
    grid-column: 1 / 4;
    background-color: palegreen;
  }
</style>
```

There's a single `<main>` landmark element. The `<main>` element identifies the main content of the document. There should be only one `<main>` per page.

The `<aside>` is for content that is indirectly or tangentially related to the document's main content.

An `<article>` represents a complete, or self-contained, section of content that is, in principle, independently reusable.

The `<section>` element is used to encompass generic standalone sections of a document when there is no more specific semantic element to use. Sections should have a heading, with very few exceptions.

A `<section>` isn't a landmark unless it has an accessible name. Landmark roles should be used sparingly, to identify larger overall sections of the document. Using too many landmark roles can create "noise" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.

> Going back to the Jacinda Ardern example, on the home page of the newspaper, the banner would include the name of the newspaper, followed by a single `<main>`, divided into several `<section>`s, each with a header, such as "World news" and "Politics"; and in each section you'll find a series of `<article>`s. Within each `<article>`, you might find one or more `<section>` elements as well.

section안에 article안에 section이 가능한듯.

Heading이 헤더에 있으면 사이트의 헤더, 메인에 있으면 전체 사이트가 아닌 페이지의 헤더, article이나 section안에 있으면 서브섹션의 헤더.

It is recommended to use heading levels similarly to heading levels in a text editor: starting with a h1 as the main heading, with h2 as headings for sub-sections, and h3 if those sub-sections have sections; avoid skipping heading levels.

[Good article on section heading](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements). 아직 읽어보지는 않음.

## Attributes

> Learn about the different global attributes along with attributes specific to particular HTML elements.

**Attributes** are space-separated names and name/value pairs appearing in the opening tag, providing information about and functionality for the element.

Boolean attributes include autofocus, inert, checked, disabled, required, reversed, allowfullscreen, default, loop, autoplay, controls, muted, readonly, multiple, and selected.

```js
// When toggling between true and false, add and remove the attribute altogether with JavaScript rather than toggling the value.
const myMedia = document.getElementById('mediaFile');
myMedia.removeAttribute('muted');
myMedia.setAttribute('muted');
```

**Enumerated attributes** have a limited set of predefined valid values. Unlike boolean attributes, though, omitting the attribute doesn't mean it's false.

**Global attributes** are attributes that can be set on any HTML element.

id attribute 기능 많네,,,

- The target of a link's fragment identifier.
- Identifying an element for scripting.
- Associating a form element with its label.
- Providing a label or description for assistive technologies.
- Targeting styles with (high specificity or as attribute selectors) in CSS.

minifier 말고 emojifier 만들면 재밌을듯,,,

The browser gives us a free "top of page" link. Setting href="#top", case-insensitive, or simply href="#", will scroll the user to the top of the page. The fragment identifier is always the last part of the URL and is not sent to the server.

The HTML `<label>` element has a for attribute that takes as its value the id of the form control with which it is associated.

```html
<!-- Implicit label -->
<label>
  Send me a reminder
  <input
    type="number"
    name="min"
  />
  before the workshop resumes </label
>.
```

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Question 5: Who is an aspiring load balancer?</legend>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <input
        type="radio"
        name="q5"
        value="blendan"
        id="q5blendan"
      />
      <label for="q5blendan">Blendan Smooth</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        type="radio"
        name="q5"
        value="hoover"
        id="q5hoover"
      />
      <label for="q5hoover">Hoover Sukhdeep</label>
    </li>
  </ul>
</fieldset>
```

```html
<section
  id="about"
  aria-labelledby="about_heading"
>
  <h2 id="about_heading">What you'll learn</h2>
</section>
```

Using aria-labelledby, you can create a reverse association from a form control to multiple labels, including text not nested in a `<label>`, whether the text labels more than one form control or not. If a control has both `<label>` and aria-labelledby, the aria-labelledby has precedence; users will not hear the `<label>` text unless the aria-labelledby includes the id of the label???

The class attribute provides no purpose in HTML. It's not that you shouldn't use the class attribute, it's just that most developers don't realize they often don't need to.

The styles are only applied to the element on which the attribute is set, with descendants inheriting inherited property values if not overridden by other style declarations on nested elements or in `<style>` blocks or style sheets??

While style is indeed a global attribute, using it is not recommended. Rather, define styles in a separate file or files.

The tabindex attribute can be added to any element to enable it to receive focus. A tabindex value of 0 makes the element focusable and reachable via tabbing, adding it to the default tab order of the page in source code order. A value of 1 or more puts the element into a prioritized focus sequence and is not recommended.

```html
<body>
  <p>Click in any input, then hit the tab key.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="3"
        value="3"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="6"
        value="6"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="2"
        value="2"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="0"
        value="0"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="0"
        value="0"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="-1"
        value="-1"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="0"
        value="0"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="8"
        value="8"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="1"
        value="1"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="5"
        value="5"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="7"
        value="7"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <input
        tabindex="4"
        value="4"
      />
    </li>
  </ol>
</body>
```
