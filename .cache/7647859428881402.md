A network is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to eachother

The internet is a network of networks.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router.

Packet: A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.

Router: A device that directs packets of data between different networks.

IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination.

Domain Name: A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as google.com.

DNS: The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.

HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When you visit a website, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or other resource you've requested.

HTTPS: An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.

SSL/TLS: The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet.

A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems. They allow devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate with each other seamlessly.

Ports: Ports are used to identify the application or service running on a device. Each application or service is assigned a unique port number, allowing data to be sent to the correct destination.

Sockets: A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication. Sockets are used to establish connections between devices and transfer data between applications.

Connections: A connection is established between two sockets when two devices want to communicate with each other. During the connection establishment process, the devices negotiate various parameters such as the maximum segment size and window size, which determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.

Data transfer: Once a connection is established, data can be transferred between the applications running on each device. Data is typically transmitted in segments, with each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable delivery.

Certificates: SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server. They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority) to verify their authenticity.

Edge computing: Edge computing refers to the processing and storage of data at the edge of the network, rather than in centralized data centers. It is expected to enable new use cases and applications, such as real-time analytics and low-latency applications.

## Conclusion

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that uses a standard set of communication protocols to exchange data.

The internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using standardized protocols, such as IP and TCP.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers that direct traffic between different devices and systems.

Basic concepts and terminology that you need to familiarize yourself with include packets, routers, IP addresses, domain names, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS.

Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet, allowing devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate seamlessly.
