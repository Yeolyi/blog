### Start a New React Project

React is a **library** that lets you organize UI code by breaking it apart into pieces called components.

React doesn’t take care of routing or data management.

[Can I use React without a framework?](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#can-i-use-react-without-a-framework) - You can definitely use React without a framework—that’s how you’d use React for a part of your page. However, if you’re building a new app or a site fully with React, we recommend using a framework. Here's why. Even if you don’t need routing or data fetching at first, you’ll likely want to add some libraries for them. ... Changing your setup to run some of your code on the server or during the build can be very tricky. ... These problems are not React-specific. This is why Svelte has SvelteKit, Vue has Nuxt, and so on. React frameworks on this page solve problems like these by default, with no extra work from your side.

```js
// This component runs *only* on the server (or during the build).
async function Talks({ confId }) {
  // 1. You're on the server, so you can talk to your data layer. API endpoint not required.
  const talks = await db.Talks.findAll({ confId });

  // 2. Add any amount of rendering logic. It won't make your JavaScript bundle larger.
  const videos = talks.map((talk) => talk.video);

  // 3. Pass the data down to the components that will run in the browser.
  return <SearchableVideoList videos={videos} />;
}
```

Server Components and Suspense are React features rather than Next.js features. However, adopting them at the framework level requires buy-in and non-trivial implementation work. At the moment, the Next.js App Router is the most complete implementation. The React team is working with bundler developers to make these features easier to implement in the next generation of frameworks.

## Add React to an Existing Project

생략

## Editor Setup

Make sure that you’ve enabled all the eslint-plugin-react-hooks rules for your project. They are essential and catch the most severe bugs early. The recommended eslint-config-react-app preset already includes them.

Next.js는 알아서 기본값으로 있는듯?

If your ESLint preset has formatting rules, they may conflict with Prettier. We recommend disabling all formatting rules in your ESLint preset using eslint-config-prettier so that ESLint is only used for catching logical mistakes. If you want to enforce that files are formatted before a pull request is merged, use prettier --check for your continuous integration.
