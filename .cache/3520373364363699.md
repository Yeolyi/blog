> In the years of IE 90% dominance there was nothing much to do but regard the browser as a "black box", but now, with open source browsers having more than half of the usage share, it's a good time to take a peek under the engine's hood and see what's inside a web browser. Well, what's inside are millions of C++ lines…

> As a web developer, learning the internals of browser operations helps you make better decisions and know the justifications behind development best practices. While this is a rather lengthy document, we recommend you spend some time digging in; we guarantee you'll be glad you did.

## Introduction

I will give examples from the open source browsers Firefox and Chrome, and Safari (which is partly open source).

The main function of a browser is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications. These specifications are maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) organization, which is the standards organization for the web.

The browser's main components are:

- The user interface: this includes the address bar, back/forward button, bookmarking menu, etc. Every part of the browser display **except the window where you see the requested page**.
- The browser engine: marshals actions between the UI and the rendering engine.
- The rendering engine: responsible for displaying requested content.
- Networking
- UI backend: used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. This backend exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods.
- JavaScript interpreter
- Data storage

It is important to note that browsers such as Chrome run multiple instances of the rendering engine: one for each tab. Each tab runs in a separate process.

Different browsers use different rendering engines: Internet Explorer uses Trident, Firefox uses Gecko, Safari uses WebKit. Chrome and Opera (from version 15) use Blink, a fork of WebKit.

WebKit is an open source rendering engine which started as an engine for the Linux platform and was modified by Apple to support Mac and Windows. See webkit.org for more details.

## The main flow

The rendering engine will start getting the contents of the requested document from the networking layer.

1. Parsing HTML to construct the DOM tree
1. Render tree construction: Styling information together with visual instructions in the HTML will be used to create another tree: the render tree.
1. Layout of the render tree: giving each node the exact coordinates where it should appear on the screen.
1. Painting the render tree: the render tree will be traversed and each node will be painted using the UI backend layer.

Parsing a document means translating it to a structure the code can use. Parsing is based on the syntax rules the document obeys: the language or format it was written in. Every format you can parse must have deterministic grammar consisting of vocabulary and syntax rules. It is called a **context free grammar**.

Parsing can be separated into two sub processes: lexical analysis and syntax analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of breaking the input into tokens. Syntax analysis is the applying of the language syntax rules.

Lexer (sometimes called tokenizer) that is responsible for breaking the input into valid tokens

Parser that is responsible for constructing the **parse tree** by analyzing the document structure according to the language syntax rules.

Parsing is often used in translation: transforming the input document to another format, like compiler.

Vocabulary is usually expressed by regular expressions.

```
INTEGER: 0|[1-9][0-9]*
PLUS: +
MINUS: -
```

Syntax is usually defined in a format called BNF.

```
expression :=  term  operation  term
operation :=  PLUS | MINUS
term := INTEGER | expression
```

An intuitive definition of a context free grammar is a grammar that can be entirely expressed in BNF. For a formal definition see Wikipedia's article on Context-free grammar.

There are two types of parsers: top down parsers and bottom up parsers.

There are tools that can generate a parser. It's not easy to create an optimized parser by hand.

WebKit uses two well known parser generators: **Flex** for creating a lexer and **Bison** for creating a parser (you might run into them with the names Lex and Yacc). Flex input is a file containing regular expression definitions of the tokens. Bison's input is the language syntax rules in BNF format.

## HTML Parser

The job of the HTML parser is to parse the HTML markup into a parse tree.

HTML cannot easily be defined by a context free grammar that parsers need. The difference between HTML and XML(which has lots of available parsers) is that the HTML approach is more "forgiving".

HTML definition is in a DTD format. As we saw earlier, the HTML DTD doesn't form a context free grammar.

The output tree (the "parse tree") is a tree of DOM element and attribute nodes. DOM is short for Document Object Model. It is the object presentation of the HTML document and the interface of HTML elements to the outside world like JavaScript. The root of the tree is the "Document" object. Like HTML, DOM is specified by the W3C organization.

HTML이 regular parser로 안되는 또 다른 이유로는 dynamic code(such as script elements)가 extra token을 더할 수 있음.

[Parsing algorithm in HTML5 specification](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html). Tokenization과 tree construction으로 구성.

The **tokenization** algorithm is expressed as a state machine.

During the **tree construction** stage the DOM tree with the Document in its root will be modified and elements will be added to it. The algorithm is also described as a state machine.

At this stage the browser will mark the document as interactive and start parsing scripts that are in "deferred" mode: those that should be executed after the document is parsed. The document state will be then set to "complete" and a "load" event will be fired.

There are known invalid HTML constructs repeated on many sites, and the browsers try to fix them in a way conformant with other browsers.

## CSS parsing

Unlike HTML, CSS is a context free grammar and can be parsed using the types of parsers described in the introduction. The syntax grammer is described in BNF.

```
ruleset
  : selector [ ',' S* selector ]*
    '{' S* declaration [ ';' S* declaration ]* '}' S*
  ;
selector
  : simple_selector [ combinator selector | S+ [ combinator? selector ]? ]?
  ;
simple_selector
  : element_name [ HASH | class | attrib | pseudo ]*
  | [ HASH | class | attrib | pseudo ]+
  ;
class
  : '.' IDENT
  ;
element_name
  : IDENT | '*'
  ;
attrib
  : '[' S* IDENT S* [ [ '=' | INCLUDES | DASHMATCH ] S*
    [ IDENT | STRING ] S* ] ']'
  ;
pseudo
  : ':' [ IDENT | FUNCTION S* [IDENT S*] ')' ]
  ;
```

WebKit uses Flex and Bison parser generators to create parsers automatically from the CSS grammar files. Each CSS file is parsed into a StyleSheet object. Each object contains CSS rules.

## The order of processing scripts and style sheets

The parsing of the document halts until the script has been executed. This was the model for many years and is also specified in HTML4 and 5 specifications. HTML5 adds an option to mark the script as asynchronous so it will be parsed and executed by a different thread.

Speculative parsing - While executing scripts, another thread parses the rest of the document and finds out what other resources need to be loaded from the network and loads them. In this way, resources can be loaded on parallel connections and overall speed is improved.

Conceptually it seems that since style sheets don't change the DOM tree, there is no reason to wait for them and stop the document parsing. There is an issue, though, of scripts asking for style information during the document parsing stage.

## Render tree construction

While the DOM tree is being constructed, the browser constructs another tree, the render tree. It is the visual representation of the document. The purpose of this tree is to enable painting the contents in their correct order.

```cpp
// WebKit's RenderObject class, the base class of the renderers
class RenderObject{
  virtual void layout();
  virtual void paint(PaintInfo);
  virtual void rect repaintRect();
  Node* node;  //the DOM node
  RenderStyle* style;  // the computed style
  RenderLayer* containgLayer; //the containing z-index layer
}
```

Each renderer represents a rectangular area usually corresponding to a node's CSS box.

The renderers correspond to DOM elements, but the relation is not one to one.

In WebKit the process of resolving the style and creating a renderer is called "attachment". Every DOM node has an "attach" method. Attachment is synchronous, node insertion to the DOM tree calls the new node "attach" method.

Style computation brings up a few difficulties. Style data is a very large construct, holding the numerous style properties, this can cause memory problems. Finding the matching rules for each element can cause performance issues if it's not optimized. etc...

## Layout

When the renderer is created and added to the tree, it does not have a position and size. Calculating these values is called layout or reflow.

HTML uses a flow based layout model, meaning that most of the time it is possible to compute the geometry in a single pass. Elements later "in the flow" typically do not affect the geometry of elements that are earlier "in the flow", so layout can proceed left-to-right, top-to-bottom through the document.

Layout is a recursive process.

In order not to do a full layout for every small change, browsers use a "dirty bit" system. A renderer that is changed or added marks itself and its children as "dirty": needing layout.

Incremental layout - only dirty renderers and their children are laid out.

Incremental layout is done asynchronously. Global layout will usually be triggered synchronously.

**The layout process**

1. Parent renderer determines its own width.
1. Parent goes over children and:
   1. Place the child renderer(sets its x and y)
   1. Calls child layout if needede.
1. Parent uses children's accumulate heights and the heights of margins and padding to set its own height.
1. Sets its dirty bit to false.

The renderer's width is calculated using the container block's width, the renderer's style "width" property, the margins and borders.

**Width calculation**

The container width is the maximum of the containers availableWidth and 0. The availableWidth in this case is the contentWidth which is calculated as:

```c
// clientWidth and clientHeight represent the interior of an object excluding border and scrollbar.
clientWidth() - paddingLeft() - paddingRight()
```

If the preferred width is greater then the maximum width, the maximum width is used. If it is less then the minimum width (the smallest unbreakable unit) then the minimum width is used.

## Painting

In the painting stage, the render tree is traversed and the renderer's "paint()" method is called to display content on the screen. Painting uses the UI infrastructure component.

CSS2 defines the order of the painting process. This is actually the order in which the elements are stacked in the stacking contexts. This order affects painting since the stacks are painted from back to front. The stacking order of a block renderer is:

1. background color
1. background image
1. border
1. children
1. outline

The rendering engine is single threaded. Almost everything, except network operations, happens in a single thread.

Network operations can be performed by several parallel threads.

The browser main thread is an event loop. It's an infinite loop that keeps the process alive. It waits for events (like layout and paint events) and processes them.
