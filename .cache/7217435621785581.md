Simply put, Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to convey the meaning of the content on a web page, rather than just its appearance.

- it helps search engines and other technologies understand the structure and purpose of the content on your site.
- it makes your content more accessible to people who use assistive technologies to navigate the web.
- it makes your code easier to read and maintain, since the purpose of each element is clear.

The <header> tag is used to mark up the top section of a web page, which typically includes the main title or logo, navigation links, and other elements that are common to every page on the site.

The <nav> tag is used to mark up a section of a web page that contains navigation links.

The <main> tag is used to mark up the main content area of a web page.

The <article> tag is used to represent a standalone piece of content, such as a blog post, news article, or product review. The content within the <article> tag should be **self-contained and meaningful**, and can include headings, paragraphs, images, and other types of content.

The <aside> tag is used to mark up content that is related to the main content on a web page but is not an integral part of it. This might include things like supplementary information, advertisements, or related articles.

The <section> tag is used to mark up sections of a web page that are thematically grouped together. This might include things like chapters or sections of a long article, or different parts of a product page.

The <footer> tag is used to mark up the bottom section of a web page, which might include things like copyright information, contact details, or links to social media profiles.

The <details> and <summary> tags are used to mark up a collapsible section of content. The <summary> tag is used to mark up the title of the section, and the <details> tag is used to mark up the content itself.

```html
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  <p>Content goes here</p>
</details>
```

The <figure> and <figcaption> tags are used to mark up a self-contained piece of content that is referenced from the main content of a web page. The <figure> tag is used to mark up the content itself, and the <figcaption> tag is used to mark up a caption or description for the content.

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="image.jpg"
    alt="Image description"
  />
  <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The <mark> tag is used to mark up text that has been highlighted for some reason. This might include things like search results, or text that has been highlighted by a user.

The <time> tag is used to mark up a date or time.

The <progress> tag is used to mark up a progress bar.

The <div> and <span> tags are not semantic tags. They are used to mark up generic content areas, and do not convey any specific meaning. You should only use these tags if you have no other option.
