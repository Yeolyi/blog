Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

(Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code.)

To enable CSP, you need to configure your web server to return the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header

## Threats

### Mitigating cross-site scripting

A primary goal of CSP is to mitigate and report XSS attacks.

CSP makes it possible for server administrators to reduce or eliminate the vectors by which XSS can occur by specifying the domains that the browser should consider to be valid sources of executable scripts. A CSP compatible browser will then only execute scripts loaded in source files received from those allowed domains, ignoring all other scripts (including inline scripts and event-handling HTML attributes).

### Mitigating packet sniffing attacks

The server can specify which protocols are allowed to be used.

## Using CSP

Configuring Content Security Policy involves adding the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header to a web page and giving it values to control what resources the user agent is allowed to load for that page.
