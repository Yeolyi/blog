[What is a Domain Name?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_domain_name).

IP addresses are hard to remember and might change over time. To solve all those problems we use human-readable addresses called domain names. **Read from right to left**.

**TLD**(.com, .org, .net) tell users the general purpose of the servie behind the domain name.

The **labels** are what follow the TLD. A label is a case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from one to sixty-three characters in length, containing only the letters A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and the '-' character (which may not be the first or last character in the label).

[What Is Web Hosting? Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htbY9-yggB0). The computer and network infrasturcture that keeps your website available across the internet. All starts from server.Data center provides network and power connectivity with temperature control, security, etc... What you're actually buying is physical disk space on the server as well as bandwidth which is the network connection for the server. Popular control panel is 'cPanel'. ,,,왜봤지?

You cannot "buy a domain name". Instead, you pay for the right to use a domain name for one or more years. Companies called registrars use domain name registries to keep track of technical and administrative information connecting you to your domain name.

```sh
whois yeolyi.com
```

DNS databases are stored on every DNS server worldwide, and all these servers refer to a few special servers called "authoritative name servers" or "top-level DNS servers" — these are like the boss servers that manage the system.

Whenever your registrar creates or updates any information for a given domain, the information must be **refreshed** in every DNS database.

1. Type mozilla.org in your browser's location bar
1. Your browser asks your computer if it already recognizes the IP address identified by this domain name (using a local DNS cache).
1. If your computer does not know, it goes on to ask a DNS server.
1. Now computer knows the requested IP address, your browser can negotiate contents with the web server.

### Hosting

## Version Control Systems

> Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code – if you’ve ever collaborated with other people on a project, you might already know the frustration of copying and merging the changes from someone else into your codebase; version control systems allow you to get rid of this issue.

> There are different repository hosting services with the most famous one being GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. I would recommend creating an account on GitHub because that is where most of the OpenSource work is done and most of the developers are.

> GitHub is a provider of internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

## Web Security Knowledge

> Web security refers to the protective measures taken by the developers to protect the web applications from threats that could affect the business.

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project(OWASP) is an online community that produces freely-available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the field of web application security.

[What is HTTPS?](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-https/).

Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer.

HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, although formerly it was known as **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**. This protocol secures communications by using what’s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure. This type of security system uses the private key and the public key.

In websites without HTTPS, it is possible for Internet service providers (ISPs) or other intermediaries to inject content into webpages without the approval of the website owner.

HTTPS uses port 443. This differentiates HTTPS from HTTP, which uses port 80.

Technically speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol from HTTP. It is simply using TLS/SSL encryption over the HTTP protocol. HTTPS occurs based upon the transmission of TLS/SSL certificates, which verify that a particular provider is who they say they are.

When a user connects to a webpage, the webpage will send over its SSL certificate which contains the public key necessary to start the secure session.

## CSS architecture

## CSS Preprocessors

> CSS Preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the default capabilities of CSS. They enable us to use logic in our CSS code, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, functions, and mathematical operations.

[CSS Preprocessors Explained](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-preprocessors/).

CSS Preprocessors compile the code which is written using a special compiler. They then use that to create a CSS file, which can then be referenced by the main HTML document.

```sass
// Variables
$yourcolor: #000056
.yourDiv {
  color: $yourcolor;
}

// Loops
@for $vfoo 35px to 85px {
  .margin-#{vfoo} {
    margin: $vfoo 10px;
   }
 }

// If/Else
@if width(body) > 500px {
background color: blue;
} else {
background color: white;
}
```

[What is a CSS Preprocessors & Why Use Them](https://sherocommerce.com/what-is-a-css-preprocessors-why-use-them/) There are three main preprocessors – Sass, LESS and Stylus.

### SASS

Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.

Sass has two syntaxes! The **SCSS syntax** (.scss) is used most commonly. It’s a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is also valid SCSS. The **indented syntax** (.sass) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to separate them. All our examples are available in both syntaxes.

```scss
// Variables
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}

// Nesting
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li {
    display: inline-block;
  }
}

// Partials
// You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files.
// This is a great way to modularize your CSS.

// Modules
@use 'base';

.inverse {
  background-color: base.$primary-color;
  color: white;
}

// Mixins
// A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site.
// It helps keep your Sass very DRY.
@mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) {
  background: $theme;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, 0.25);
  color: #fff;
}

.info {
  @include theme;
}
.alert {
  @include theme($theme: DarkRed);
}
.success {
  @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);
}

// Extend/Interitance
/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: green;
}

// Operators
@use 'sass:math';

article[role='main'] {
  width: math.div(600px, 960px) * 100%;
}
```

## Build Tools

### Linters and Formatters

> A linter is a tool used to analyze code and discover bugs, syntax errors, stylistic inconsistencies, and suspicious constructs. Popular linters for JavaScript include ESLint, JSLint, and JSHint.

> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, YAML, Markdown, GraphQL Schemas. By far the biggest reason for adopting Prettier is to stop all the on-going debates over styles.

### Task Runners

> Task Runner are tools to simplify certain tedious tasks of development, like automating sass/scss compilation, bundling assets, linting source code, and hot reloading local server.

> npm scripts are the entries in the scripts field of the package.json file. The scripts field holds an object where you can specify various commands and scripts that you want to expose.

### Module Bundlers

## Pick a Framework

> Web frameworks are designed to write web applications. Frameworks are collections of libraries that aid in the development of a software product or website. Frameworks for web application development are collections of various tools. Frameworks vary in their capabilities and functions, depending on the tasks set. They define the structure, establish the rules, and provide the development tools required.

[React](../react) is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Modern CSS

> The way we write CSS in our modern front-end applications is completely different from how we used to write CSS before. There are methods such as Styled Components, CSS Modules, Styled JSX, Emotion, etc

> Styled-components is a CSS-in-JS library that enables you to write regular CSS and attach it to JavaScript components. With styled-components, you can use the CSS you’re already familiar with instead of having to learn a new styling structure.

## CSS Frameworks

> A CSS framework provides the user with a fully functional CSS stylesheet, allowing them to create a web page by simply coding the HTML with appropriate classes, structure, and IDs. Classes for popular website features like as the footer, slider, navigation bar, hamburger menu, column-based layouts, and so on are already included in the framework.

### JS first

> Tailwind CSS: CSS Framework that provides atomic CSS classes to help you style components e.g. flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

> Material-UI is an open-source framework that features React components that implement Google’s Material Design.

## Web Components

## Type Checkers

> Type checker helps developers write code with fewer bugs by adding types to their code, trying to catch type errors within your code, and then removing them during compile time. Flow and TypeScript are two popular static type checkers for JavaScript.

> TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## Progressive Web Apps

> Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are websites that are progressively enhanced to function like installed, native apps on supporting platforms, while functioning like regular websites on other browsers.

### Web Storage API

> The Web Storage API provides mechanisms for storing key-value pairs in a web browser. It includes two storage objects: localStorage and sessionStorage, which allow you to save data on the client side and persist it across multiple browser sessions, respectively.

> The Web Storage API is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it is widely supported across modern web browsers. It is often used as an alternative to cookies, as it allows for larger amounts of data to be stored and is more efficient in terms of performance.

sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session.

localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.

Window.sessionStorage, Window.localStorage 프로퍼티로 사용한다.

Private windows, incognito mode, and similarly named privacy browsing options, don't store data like history and cookies. In private mode, localStorage is treated like sessionStorage. The storage APIs are still available and fully functional, but all data stored in the private window is deleted when the browser or browser tab is closed.

The StorageEvent is fired whenever a change is made to the Storage object (note that this event is not fired for sessionStorage changes). This won't work on the same page that is making the changes — it is really a way for other pages on the domain using the storage to sync any changes that are made. Pages on other domains can't access the same storage objects.

```js
window.addEventListener('storage', (e) => {
  document.querySelector('.my-key').textContent = e.key;
  document.querySelector('.my-old').textContent = e.oldValue;
  document.querySelector('.my-new').textContent = e.newValue;
  document.querySelector('.my-url').textContent = e.url;
  document.querySelector('.my-storage').textContent = JSON.stringify(e.storageArea);
});
```

## Server Side Rendering(SSR)

> Server-side rendering refers to the process that the service side completes the HTML structure splicing of the page, sends it to the browser, and then binds the status and events for it to become a fully interactive page.

Faster page load / SEO friendly

Complexity / Rendering a big application on the server-side can be very time consuming and it may increase the loading time due to it being a single bottleneck.

## Static Site Generators

> A static site generator is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates. Essentially, a static site generator automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built, they can load very quickly in users’ browsers.

[Cloudflare - What is a static site generator?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/)

In the early days of the Internet, websites were stored as static HTML sites, with all webpages laid out and hard coded in advance. This was inefficient because it required developers to code each webpage manually.

Content management systems (CMS) emerged as a way for developers to avoid all that manual setup. Instead of coding the pages ahead of time, content is stored in a CMS database, and when a user requests a page, the server does the following:

1. Queries the database for the right content
1. Identifies the template the content will fit into
1. Generates the page
1. Serves the page to the user

A static site generator is a compromise between these two approaches. Like a CMS, it allows developers to use templates and automatically generates webpages — but it does the latter ahead of time, instead of in response to a user's request.

Performance / Customization / Lighter backend

Few or no pre-built templates / No user-friendly interface

[How Next.js Works](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering)

Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation are also referred to as Pre-Rendering. In a standard React application, the browser receives an empty HTML shell from the server along with the JavaScript instructions to construct the UI. This is called **client-side rendering** because the initial rendering work happens on the user's device. With **server-side rendering**, the HTML of the page is generated on a server for each request. The generated HTML, JSON data, and JavaScript instructions to make the page interactive are then sent to the client. On the client, the HTML is used to show a fast non-interactive page, while React uses the JSON data and JavaScript instructions to make components interactive (for example, attaching event handlers to a button). This process is called **hydration**. With **Static Site Generation**, the HTML is generated on the server, but unlike server-side rendering, there is no server at runtime. Instead, content is generated once, at build time, when the application is deployed, and the HTML is stored in a CDN and re-used for each request.
