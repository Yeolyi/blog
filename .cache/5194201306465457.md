Changing the value of the display property can change whether the outer display type of a box is block or inline. This changes the way it displays alongside other elements in the layout.

Making up a block box in CSS we have the:

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

Note: The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box — sure, it affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but only the space outside the box. The box's area stops at the border — it does not extend into the margin.

### Margins, padding, and borders

Depending on whether two elements whose margins touch have positive or negative margins, the results will be different:

- Two positive margins will combine to become one margin. Its size will be equal to the largest individual margin.
- Two negative margins will collapse and the smallest (furthest from zero) value will be used.
- If one margin is negative, its value will be subtracted from the total.

Unlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding.

In inline boxes, width and height are ignored. The vertical margin, padding, and border are respected but don't change the relationship of other content to our inline box.

```html
<style>
  /* 수평 margin은 적용되긴 한다 */
  /* padding을 넣어도 주변 요소들이 밀리지 않는다 */
  span {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 10px;
    width: 80px;
    height: 5px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    border: 2px solid blue;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <p>
    I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A span is an inline
    element and so does not respect width and height.
  </p>
</body>
```

display: inline-block is a special value of display, which provides a middle ground between inline and block. Use it if you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect width and height and avoid the overlapping seen above.
